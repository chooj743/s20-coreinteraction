		<h1><span id="blur">I planned to get up early in the morning, brush my teeth, boil water, maybe get a double portion breakfast, code, eat ice cream, more coding, escape from coding by grabbing lunch, choose between pizza and single burger, play a new game on phone, go to the library, watch a movie on Netflix, take a nap after, have a chat over the phone with my friends, plan itinerary for weekends, snack on junk foods, update my creative process journal, head down to MoMA, walk aimlessly around nearby streets, take photographs of anything interesting, walk in to a random store to avoid the cold wind outside, go grocery shopping, prepare the ingredients, eat dinner, do the dishes, take out the trash, take a shower, blow dry my hair, vacuum the floor, do research on assignments, use Instagram but </span><a href="index-one.html">I ended up doing just my laundry.</a></h1>
