	<p class="vertical-text">I planned to get up early in the morning, brush my teeth, boil water, maybe get a double portion breakfast, code, eat ice cream, walk aimlessly around nearby streets, more coding, escape from coding by grabbing lunch, go to the library, read a book, plan itinerary for weekends, play a new game on phone, watch a movie, take a nap after, have a chat over the phone with my friends, update my creative process journal, head down to a museum, take photographs of anything interesting, walk in to a random store to avoid the cold wind outside, go grocery shopping, prepare the ingredients, eat dinner, do the dishes, take out the trash, take a shower, blow dry my hair, vacuum the floor, do research on assignments, apply for internships but I ended up doing just snacking on <a href="index-six.html">junk foods</a>.</p>
